                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Contrast: </strong>The website has strong contrast with headings and body text, making it easy to read.
                            The links are brightly colored against the white background, helping the user spot what is important.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Repetition: </strong>The colors, fonts, and sizes of the text and buttons are repeated throughout the 
                            site, increasing usability. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Alignment: </strong>All the content is organized using a grid system, creating a structured layout for 
                            the site. This makes the site easy to scan and appealing for the user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Proximity: </strong>The related navigation links are grouped together, allowing user to quickly understand
                            relationships between the actions and information. Features are grouped with headings and descriptions to create
                            a better understanding for the user.

                <h3>
                    <a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org" target="_blank">Craigslist</a>
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Contrast: </strong>This website does not have visual hierarchy. Elements do not stand out 
                            and almost all text has the same size. The text color and font are the same throughout all the pages with no focal points.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Repetition: </strong>While repetition is there, all links and categories look the same, making it 
                            overly repetitive. This makes it difficult for users to notice important details. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Alignment: </strong>There are long lists of text under each category with little spacing between each 
                            list making the page seem dense. Most text is left-aligned but spacing is inconsistent.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Proximity: </strong>The different categories are grouped together but there are way too many links
                            crammed under that have little spacing between each, making it hard to scan. 
                    </li>
